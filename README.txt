# Smart Contracts – ArcOfLife AI

This repository contains Solidity smart contracts developed and tested using Remix IDE.
It serves as a working codebase for learning, experimentation, and future production-ready contracts.

## Purpose

- Learning and experimenting with Solidity
- Prototyping Ethereum smart contracts
- Version-controlled storage of Remix IDE projects
- Foundation for future audits and production deployments

## Structure

- contracts/  
  Solidity smart contracts

- scripts/  
  Deployment and interaction scripts (Remix / ethers.js)

- tests/  
  Basic Solidity and JavaScript tests

- artifacts/  
  Compiled contract artifacts generated by Remix

## Workflow

1. Contracts are written and tested in Remix IDE
2. Projects are connected directly to this GitHub repository
3. Changes are committed from Remix or GitHub editor
4. Deployment is performed via Remix VM or external wallets (later phase)

## Status

⚠️ Development / Experimental  
These contracts are NOT audited and NOT intended for mainnet use yet.
